This week's homework challenge was to re-factor some of the code for a given site to make said site a little more accessible to users who utilize assistive technologies, as well as Google search engines. This was done by adding alt attributes to all images, concise descriptions to title elements, and making sure all HTML elements follow a logical structure.

## Usage

To view the source code of the webpage, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the source code of the webpage.
